			We looked for a men’s carry bag<br />
			but nothing was quite right, so<br />
			we decided to make it ourselves.<br />
			Seriously. It’s the American way!
			</div>
 			<p>Virgil James took shape during the process of creating a single “object of desire” to become what you see today.  We know, a bit crazy, but look at the results!</p>
			<p>Our original goal was based on years of travel, with bags of all shapes, sizes, and descriptions that never quite did the job.  Was it really too much to ask for a bag to be simultaneously stylish, high quality, and functional?  Admittedly, our quality standards are over the top and functional means never checking a bag regardless of the destination and time away.  And stylish, let’s not even go there!  Indeed, the whole package was nearly impossible to find, so we began this journey in 2012.</p>
			<p>Along the way, we realized that others might value and desire what we were creating, so a “collection” of men’s luxury bags was conceived.  From there, it was a small step to include women’s bags and then expand those collections to create, no, engineer a lifestyle brand that reflects the themes that are important to us.</p>
			<p>As you look at our products, you’ll see these themes.  Clearly, we’re obsessed with exceptional quality.  While this is a common claim, it’s not easily accomplished.  It’s expensive and, in classic understatement, hugely time-consuming.  Our solution was to be patient and design without the burden of meeting a particular cost.  In other words, we had no budget!  We became masters of trial and error, sample and test, and questioned almost everything.  We sought the best materials and components, or made something better.  Our motto quickly became – no compromises.</p>
			<p>The theme of authenticity, or purity of intent as we like to think of it, is expressed in every Virgil James product.  It’s part of the lifestyle we espouse.  We design with purpose.  We don’t cut corners or try to save money on the parts you don’t see.  We build every product with American craftsman who take enormous pride in the “art” they create.  In the end, every piece of the puzzle fits to ensure a genuine experience for you.</p>
			<p>Functional, everyday use is also part of our brand DNA.  We expect things to work, and work well for the lifetime of our customers.  We’d love to see our products passed down to the next generation.  By designing for the long-term – for the look, utility, or durability – we create true lasting value.  In fact, we’re so confident of this value that we offer one of the most unusual guarantees in the business.  Like a piece of appreciating art, we’ll repurchase any of the limited edition bags we sell with credit to purchase a new Virgil James bag.</p> 
			<p>Indeed, we do things differently.  We’re guided to meet our own expectations, which we are often reminded, are painfully high.  We treat you as we would ourselves.  As a customer you’re part of a select group that appreciates and values what we create.  Our limited editions are exactly that, and gone once the 200th bag of each style is sold.  To better support our customers we only sell direct – online or through our Ambassadors. There are no intermediaries, and no excuses. You’ll always deal just with us.</p>
			<p>So take a look at what we’ve created, or feel free to contact one of our ambassadors, and be a part of the lifestyle that we celebrate.  Thanks for visiting Virgil James.</p>
			<p>Companies are a reflection of their leaders.  As you can see, ours are unique.</p>

	 		<p>Starting a luxury fashion company was probably not part of Jay’s life plan, but it’s the curves in life that make it interesting.  Despite an eclectic perspective and lifetime of travel, Jay followed a fairly conventional career path, particularly for a Harvard MBA.  He was a private equity (i.e. venture capital) investor who happened to be fully engaged in the creative process.  In fact, so engaged that he ultimately left the business to invest in, incubate, and work directly with early-stage companies.  Serial entrepreneur maybe, but really someone who mostly enjoyed building and the art of creativity. Jay’s wide-ranging experience and strategic sense have created a foundation for what he promises will be an incredibly interesting company.  We’ll look for that, but his commitment to absurd quality, authenticity, and a lifetime of functional use make him a model customer.  He’s also a pretty interesting guy.</p>

	 		<p>Maya is the Creative Director at Virgil James and the force behind our design aesthetic – a unique blend of classic elegance and creative functionality.  This is not Maya’s first rodeo, which might be an apt characterization for the Oklahoma-bred daughter (and niece) of a family of acclaimed artists and designers.  Maya has the credentials and experience to do exactly what makes Virgil James so special.  She’s a graduate of the London College of Fashion, where she received the Jimmy Choo Award and Student Accessory Designer of the Year.  Her designs have been featured in Vogue, W Magazine, Women’s Wear Daily, Marie Claire, Vanity Fair and carried by names you would surely know, but we won’t name drop!  She’s designed for leading brands, but found the perfect fit at Virgil James – to the extreme delight of our customers. And, by the way, Maya is probably much more interesting than Jay.</p>
